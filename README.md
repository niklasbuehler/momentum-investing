Python tools for Momentum Investing
===

A simple python script that implements basic statistical methods to analyze stock data gathered from the Yahoo Finance API.
The implemented methods are the fundamentals needed to apply momentum investing strategies.
Two momentum investing strategies are already implemented as well: the simple _Absolute Momentum Strategy_ and the slightly more complex _Momentum Strategy_.

Read about the theory behind this [on my website](http://www.niklasbuehler.com/blog/momentum-investing.html).

Start the script using `python -i stocks.py`.

This was developed using Python 3.8.5.
